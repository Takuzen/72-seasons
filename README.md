# 72-seasons
Database of Japanese 72 seasons

## Introduction
Long time ago, that is more than 3000 years ago, it is said that people of the [Yin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty) dynasty (a Chinese royal dynasty ruled in the Yellow River valley) was using the lunar calendar in which the time of the winter solstice (the shortest day) is the beginning of the year, and the cycle of the phases of the moon is one month.

Gradually over the course of the [Spring and Autumn period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period), 24 seasons, then 72 seasons were born. 

In 523, the [Northern Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Wei) (another Chinese royal dynasty ruled northern China) had adopted 72 seasons into their calendar. 

Such an ancient Chinese calendar had been introduced to Japan by way of the Korean Peninsula in the mid-6th century. Though over the following 800 years the Japanese calendar had been conforming to the Chinese one, Japan and China have different weather and some descriptions include fantasy. 

Therefore, in 1685, [Harumi Shibukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibukawa_Shunkai) devised Japanese 72 seasons which lasted until it was replaced in 1873 by our current format of calendar. 

This database is based on this Japanses 72 seasons.
